<p>Given two probability distributions $\mu,\nu$, there are many situations
where one is interested in defining a way of measuring the distance
between them. The Wasserstein distance is a metric that arises from the
idea of optimal transport, and which has being gaining attention in
Statistics and Machine Learning. One prominent example is the so called
Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN), which uses this
metric to evaluate how well the model generated distribution
approximates the "real" distribution of the data. As will be shown
shortly, the Wasserstein metric has several advantages compared to other
metrics.</p>

<p>Finally, we can go back to our example, and conclude that if
$X_1,â€¦,X_n \in [a,b]$ are $i.i.d$. Then, for $S_n = X_1 + â€¦ + X_n$,
we have
\(\mu^n(|S_n - m_{S_\nu} | &gt; r + r_o) \leq 2 e^{\frac{- 2r^2}{n L^2}}\)</p>
