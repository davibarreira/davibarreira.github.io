# Welcome to my personal

I'm a PhD student at the [School of Applied Mathematics at Fundação Getúlio Vargas (EMAp)](https://emap.fgv.br/)
since beginning of 2021.

I'm interested in Mathematics in general, but my research area is Optimal Transport,
mostly applied to Machine Learning.

My main programming interest is the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language.
I'm one of the developers of the package [OptimalTransport.jl](https://github.com/JuliaOptimalTransport/OptimalTransport.jl).

In this website I have some of my blog posts, which can also
be found elsewhere:

* My publication page [Coffee in a Klein Bottle](https://medium.com/coffee-in-a-klein-bottle)
* [Github](https://github.com/davibarreira).
